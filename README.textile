Needed :

* Local mongodb install
* Run bundle install to make sure all gems are installed

h1. How to run

* Start mongodb server
* Start solr server with @sunspot-solr start@
* Start a queue of workers (see resque doc) : @QUEUE=* rake resque:work@
* Start a local server : rails server

This is still very early stage.
